Concentration Game Play and Rules
Requires
At least 2 people, but more people make for more fun
A standard deck of cards (no jokers)

Game play
1. Make sure the deck is well shuffled before laying out the cards, facedown, in four rows of 13 cards. 
2. Each player takes turns flipping two cards face-up — if they are of the same number and color (e.g., 9♠ and 9♣, or Q♥ and Q♦), then that player wins the pair and gets another turn. 
3. If the cards are not of the same number and color, they are turned back facedown and it becomes the next player’s turn to pick two cards. 
4. The game continues until players have picked up all the pairs
5. The winner is the player with the most pairs.
